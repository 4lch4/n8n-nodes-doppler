# n8n-nodes-doppler

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the `n8n-nodes-doppler` n8n Community Node is my ([@4lch4][0]) fork of [the original][1].
> Due to the sensitive nature of the data that this node handles, I have forked it to ensure that I can maintain it and keep it up to date with the latest version of n8n & Doppler. I have also added a few features that I need for my own workflows.
